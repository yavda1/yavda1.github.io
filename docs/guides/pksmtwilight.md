# PKSM + Twilight menu

PKSM is a very powerful tool that allows you to edit saves for generations 1-8. Ordinarily PKSM only detects cartridge and digital games seemingly making it impossible to use with the Twilight menu or any miscellaneous save file. However, PKSM has a feature that allows you to do this, and this guide will detail it.

!!! note
This tutorial already presumes you have PKSM and know how to use it. You can find a guide PKSM [here](/pksm). It also presumes you have the Twilight menu.

## What do I need?

- [PKSM](https://github.com/FlagBrew/PKSM/releases/10.0.0/)
- [Twilight Menu](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/TWiLightMenu/releases)

6. You will be brought to a screen with all of the directories on the root of your SD card. Navigate to the one with your save file, then click on it. They always end in `.sav`
